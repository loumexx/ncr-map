# NCR Map App

This project is a recreation of [@denzdelvillar](https://github.com/denzdelvillar)'s Philippine map, but in a smaller scale, only containing the 17 different cities in the National Captial Region of the Philippines.

## Technologies used:

- **ReactJS** (and this will be my first time using it)
- some leftover **CSS** I had from studying it for quite a bit, then stopping for a good couple months
